This Relational Database was written to enable the tracking of physical assets within the office. 
It enables the tracking of devices loaned as well as who they are loaned to and at what physical location the loaning was done from. 
It enabled me and my co-workers to more tighly regulate the distribution and monitoring of loaned physical assets in the hands of employees.
